                  Hello! My name is Jacob and I graduated from the University of
                  Missouri - Kansas City in 2021 with a BA in Economics. I have
                  long had an interest in coding and I have done some
                  self-teaching over the years. In the summer of 2022, I decided
                  to get serious about pursuing a career in software engineering
                  and enrolled in the Full-Stack Coding Bootcamp at the
                  University of Kansas. Upon my completion of this bootcamp in
                  May of 2023, I will receive my full-stack certification.

                  Outside of programming, I enjoy staying active. I like sports,
                  especially soccer, basketball, and climbing. I also love
                  movies and music. I am recently married and a new father to a
                  beautiful baby girl.
