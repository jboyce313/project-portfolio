                  Hello! My name is Jacob and I live in the Kansas City metro
                  area. I graduated from the University of Missouri - Kansas
                  City in 2021 with a BA in Economics. I have long had an
                  interest in programming. I've done some self-teaching
                  throughout the years but, in the summer of 2022, I decided I
                  wanted to get serious about persuing a career in software
                  engineering and enrolled in the Full-Stack Coding Bootcamp at
                  the University of Kansas.Upon my completion of this bootcamp
                  in May of 2023, I will receive my full-stack certification.
                  For more information on my coding competencies, please see the{" "}

                  Outside of programming, I enjoy staying active. I like sports,
                  especially soccer and climbing, and I love movies and music. I
                  am recently married and a new father to a beautiful baby girl.
